### Project purpose
The goal of this project was to work with and clean a datasets to create a tidy new dataset which could be later used in analysis. 
The output from this projects are two datsets: 

1. avg_and_std_body_acc.csv - which contains the data about mean and standard deviation of body acceleration for 30 subjects performing 6 diffrent activities.
2. avg_body_acc_per_activity_type_per_subject.csv - which contains the average of linear body acceleration for each activity type and each subject.


### Source datasets
The source datasets used in this project come from following webside http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#.

The source datasets contains measurments from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone taken during an experiment with 30 participants who performed 6 diffrent types of acticvities:  

* walking
* walking upstairs
* walking downstairs
* standing
* sitting
* laying

For me information about source datasets please refer to this website:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#



### Performed work
To get the tidy data, the following tasks has been performed:

- for avg_and_std_body_acc.csv:

    1. downloading and reading the source test and training data for measurments
    2. downloading and resding the source data anout subjects (participants)
    3. downloading and reading the source data about activities types.
    4. merging tha data together
    5. adding headers to the datasets
    6. subseting only the required data - related to the mean and standart deviation of body accelaration in all 3 dimensions (X, Y, Z)
    
- avg_body_acc_per_activity_type_per_subject.csv

    1. based on the data received from first step, the average and standart deviation has been calculated for each type of activities for each subject.  

The details to reproduce receiving the tidy data can be done using the run_analysis.R file. 
That file contains all of the steps which need to be perfromed in order to receive the two described above files.
